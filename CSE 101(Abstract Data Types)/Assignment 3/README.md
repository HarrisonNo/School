List.h -acts as header file for all of the functions of the List ADT
List.c -file that houses all of the List ADT functions, did not implement the conjugate function
Graph.c -file that houses all of the Graph ADT functions
Graph.h -acts as header file for all of the functions of the Graph ADT
GraphTest.c -homemade test file that tests all of the functions in the graph ADT(specifically the DFS version)
FindComponents.c -client that finds the strongly connected components of a graph made using the Graph ADT
MAKEFILE -makefile that is just a copy of Tantalo's example

Decided to simply use a copy of the Graph ADT from pa2, there are some extra bits leftover from pa2 BFS that are not used in pa3 DFS however it was not specified whether
the fat from pa2 should be removed. If I was supposed to trim the fat from pa2, then whoops.
