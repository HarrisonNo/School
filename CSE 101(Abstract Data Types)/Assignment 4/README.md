-List.h -acts as header file for all of the functions of the List ADT
-List.cpp -file that houses all of the List ADT functions in c++
-ListTest.cpp -homemade test file that tests all of the functions in the List ADT
-Shuffle.cpp -client that finds the number of shuffles required to get back to the original order of an n-sized deck 
-MAKEFILE -makefile that is just a copy of Tantalo's example

-All functions should be working perfectly fine in the List.cpp and Shuffle.cpp files with no memory leaks.
