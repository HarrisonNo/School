Lab2: Simple Data Path 
	-This lab introduces data paths and requires the building of a sequential logic circuit.
Files: Lab2.lgi
Instructions: Launch Lab2.lgi through Multimedia Logic, using the -/+ icons to navigate the pages and the green play button to begin the simulation. The keypad allows for the changing of numbers for the different registers. The user can then set different registers to the ALU inputs to then perform a bitwise left arithmetic shift.
