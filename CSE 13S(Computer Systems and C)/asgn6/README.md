asgn6: Public Key Cryptography

Usage: Allows the user to generate a pair of RSA keys to use for encryption/decryption.
Allows the user to encrypt a selected file to ensure it is unreadable to those without a copy of the private key.
Also allows the user to decrypt an already encrypted file to gain a copy of it's original unencrypted contents.

How to: Build the program with make/make keygen/make encrypt/make decrypt
Run ./keygen to generate a set of public and private RSA keys. Can optionally select where the keys will be placed.
Run ./encrypt -i "exampleinput.txt" -o "exampleoutput.txt" to encrypt the selected input file with the public key
generated by keygen and output the encrypted contents to the output file. 
Run ./decrypt -i "exampleinput.txt" -o "exampleoutput.txt" to decrypt the selected input file with the private key
generated by keygen and output the decrypted contents to the output file.

Known bugs: Despite my encryptor working with both the reference decryptor and my own decryptor flawlessly. My decryptor does
not flawlessly work with the reference encryptor, it reprints roughly half of the very last block present in the encrypted
file. The other 99% of the decryptor does however work, it is simply those final few words that are reprinted at the end.
