List.h -acts as header file for all of the functions of the List ADT
List.c -file that houses all of the List ADT functions, did not implement the conjugate function
Graph.c -file that houses all of the Graph ADT functions
Graph.h -acts as header file for all of the functions of the Graph ADT
GraphTest.c -homemade test file that tests all of the functions in the graph ADT
FindPath.c -client that finds the shortest path between a pair of vertices using the Graph ADT
MAKEFILE -makefile that is just a copy of Tantalo's example

Managed to eliminate all of the errors, even those from List.c. Should work flawlessly(thank goodness too, I spent way too much time on this).
